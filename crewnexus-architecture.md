- **Real-Time Inference**: Lightning-fast response times for agent decision-making
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time streaming of agent outputs
- **Structured Outputs**: JSON schema enforcement for reliable data formats

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring & Analytics
- **Live Agent Tracking**: Real-time visualization of agent activities and communications
- **Performance Metrics**: Token usage, response times, success rates
- **Workflow Visualization**: Interactive graphs showing agent interactions and task flow
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Automatic error detection and retry mechanisms

### 5. Enterprise Features
- **Multi-User Support**: Team collaboration with role-based access control
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs for external system integration
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications for workflow events
- **Export Capabilities**: Export workflows, logs, and analytics data
